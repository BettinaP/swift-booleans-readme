# Booleans

![Dolphin Guy](http://i.giphy.com/RdkwfjGlsdnRm.gif)

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Explain that the `Bool` is a data type where the value can only be **true** or **false**.
* Create variables using the Boolean literal values, `true` or `false` like so:

```swift
let isTheSkyBlue = true
let isTheGrassGreen = true
let canHumansFly = false
let canDolphinsWalk = false
```

* Explain and use all the various comparison operators:
	* Equal to (a == b)
	* Not equal to (a != b)
	* Greater than (a > b)
	* Less than (a < b)
	* Greater than or equal to (a >= b)
	* Less than or equal to (a <= b)
	

* Explain and use all of the various logical operators:
	* Logical NOT (!a)
	* Logical AND (a && b)
	* Logical OR (a || b)

```swift
1 == 1   // true because 1 is equal to 1
2 != 1   // true because 2 is not equal to 1
2 > 1    // true because 2 is greater than 1
1 < 2    // true because 1 is less than 2
1 >= 1   // true because 1 is greater than or equal to 1
2 <= 1   // false because 2 is not less than or equal to 1
```


## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int & Double type.



## Outline / Notes

* Make no assumptions. I think the idea of `Bool`'s will come easy to the student **but** I still think we should be as explicit as possible.
* Considering we're not using a narrative above, drill it home by using a lot of examples.
