## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Explain that the `Bool` type is referred to as *logical* because they can only ever be **true** or **false**. 
* Create variables using the Boolean literal values, `true` or `false` like so:

```swift
let blackBearIsBest = true
let bearsEatBeets = true
let bearsBeetsBattlestarGalactica = true
let identityTheftIsAJoke = false
```

* Utilize the `if` statement to evaluate simple conditions with only a few possible outcomes, like so:

```swift
if blackBearIsBest {
    print("The black bear is best.")
}
```

* Utilize the `else clause`, for situations when the `if ` condition is `false`, like so:

```swift
if blackBearIsBest {
    print("The black bear is best.")
} else {
    print("There's no such thing as a bear being the best.")
}
```






## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int & Double type.



## Outline / Notes

*  I like the idea of building a narrative around The Office (like I did above, including the photo of Jim pretending to be Dwight).
* Similar to the other readme's, make no assumptions. I think the idea of `Bool`'s will come easy to the student **but** I still think we should be as explicit as possible. It will make it easier for them to see what's going on with the `if` and `else clause`. 
* Challenge them to create multiple functions that take in argument(s) and return back a `Bool` that evaluates one of the arguments coming in.
* The student might get confused over the use of the curly braces `{ }`. Bring them back to their understanding of functions in how the code within that function only executes when someone calls on that function. Same thing with the `if` statement, the code only executes within those curly braces `{ }` when the statement to the right of the `if` keyword evaluates to `true`.
